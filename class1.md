## Vocabulary

<dl>
  <dt>Client</dt>
  <dd>The computer requesting the web page.</dd>

  <dt>Server</dt>
  <dd>The computer responding to the request and returning HTML.</dd>
</dl>

Note:
When you load a webpage in your browser, you are the client.

The computer that returns HTML is the server.

---

## Clients &amp; Servers

![](gdi/images/client-server.png)

JavaScript runs "client side"

JavaScript also runs "server side" (node.js)

Note:
Here is a picture of this transaction...

Traditionally, Javascript has always been associated with the client side.

---

## More Vocabulary

<dl>
  <dt>Front-End</dt>
  <dd>The outwardly visible elements of a website or application. (Client Side)</dd>

  <dt>Back-End</dt>
  <dd>The inner workings and functionality of a website or application. (Server Side)</dd>
</dl>

Note:
When you 'view source', what you're seeing is the front-end code. HTML, CSS & Javascript.

Any questions?

## what is javascript?

The most popular language on Github.
![Girl Develop It](gdi/images/popularity-on-github.png) <!-- .element: class="no-border" -->

Note:
Javascript is everywhere.

---

## what is javascript?

* The most widely deployed language in history.
* Quirky and misunderstood.
* Small but super fast.

Note:
If you have a smartphone or computer, you can run Javascript.

Javascript syntax is similar to that of C &amp; shares similarities to other languages but has some quirks too...

<ul>
  <li>Object Oriented, but based on a prototypal object system, instead of a class system.</li>
  <li>Poorly documented.</li>
  <li>No good implementations until Google's V8.</li>
</ul>

## javascript is not java

<dl>
  <dt>Javascript</dt>
  <dd>Client &amp; server-side scripting language</dd>
  <dt>Java</dt>
  <dd>Development platform designed by Sun Microsystems</dd>
</dl>

Note:
Java is to Javascript as Ham is to Hamster.

Don't confuse the two.

## History of JavaScript

* Developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape, 1995
* Originally called Livescript
* Sun develops competing technology... HotJava
* Livescript is renamed Javascript by Marc Andreesen

Note:
Marc Andreesen of Andreeson Horowitz a $4 Billion venture capital firm.

Andreesen Horowitz has invested in companies like Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb, Github, etc.

---

## History of JavaScript

* Microsoft releases JScript, 1996
* Sun and Netscape join forces
* Standardized by ECMA, 1998

Note:
Technically, Javascript is a subset of ECMAScript.

Things were pretty quiet after 1998 until...

---

## History of JavaScript

* AJAX (asynchronous requests), 2005
* jQuery (utility library), 2006
* Google V8 (javascript implementation), 2008
* Node (web server), 2010
* ES6 (next incarnation), 2015

Note:
<b>AJAX</b>  
In programming, "synchronous" refers to executing statements in order. Each statement has to wait for the previous one to finish executing.

For example: if you want to load your latest tweets onto a web page, and you do this synchronously, then a visitor to your site wonâ€™t be able to do anything until those tweets are loaded.

<b>Node</b>  
Web server written on top of the Google V8 engine. Capable of handling alot more concurrent requests than contemporary web servers.

<b>ES6</b>  
Who can tell me what the ES in ES6 stands for?

## Syntax

* Each line in JavaScript is an instruction. 
* Every instruction ends with a semicolon. 
* When the browser reads it, it "executes the script". 

<br>

    console.log('Hello');

<p>Try it out on [jsbin.com](http://jsbin.com)</p> 

---

## Variables

* Variables hold content 
* Words, numbers, dates, true/false values and more 

Declare a variable (Give it a name) 

    var bananas;


Initialize variable (Give it a value) 

    bananas = 5;


Note:
Remember your high school algebra class?

Variables are containers for values.

---

## Variables

Declare and initialize at the same time! 

    var bananas = 5;


Change value of variable. 

    bananas = 4; 


---

## Data types

* String 
* Number 
* Boolean 
* Array 
* Object 
* undefined 
* null 

Note:
A data-type describes what kinds of values can be stored in a variable.

---

## Data types

### String

http://mdn.io/string 

A group of characters in quotes. 

    var fruit = "banana";


Note:
You can use single quotes or double quotes.

---

## Data types

### Number

http://mdn.io/number 

Integers or decimals, without quotes. 

    var pi = 3.14;
    var year = 2013;
    var bananaTally = 200;


Note:
Javascript only has the one Number type.

It's common in other languages to have Integer and Floating Point (decimals) but in JS everything is just a Number.

---

## Data types


### Boolean

http://mdn.io/boolean 

True or False 

    var skyIsBlue = true;
    var grassIsPink = false;


---

## Data types

### Array

http://mdn.io/array 

Collections of values. 

    var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
    var socks = new Array('pink', 'striped', 'business');


---

## Data types

### Object

http://mdn.io/object 

Container for key, value pairs. 

    var animals = { cat: 'Fluffy', dog: 'Fido' };


---

## Data types

### undefined

http://mdn.io/undefined 

Has not been assigned a value. 

    var favoriteDinosaur;


---

## Data types

### null

http://mdn.io/null 

A purposely empty value (not the same as 0) 

    var favoriteAnimal = null;


---

## Naming rules

* Begin with a letter, _, or $ 
* Can contain letters, numbers, _ and $ 


    var hello;
    var _hello;
    var $hello;
    var hello2;


---

## Naming rules

Names are case sensitive 

    var hello;
    var Hello;
    var heLLO;


---

## Expressions

Math-y expressions! 

    var bananas = 5;
    var oranges = 2;
    var fruit = bananas + oranges;


Note:
An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

---

## Operators

|Symbol|Meaning|
|---|---|
|+|Addition|
|-|Subtraction|
|*|Multiplication|
|/|Division|
|%|Modulus|
|++|Increment|
|--|Decrement|


Note:
Modulus divides the value of one expression by the value of another, and returns the remainder.

---

## Expressions

Word-y expressions! 

    var subject = "cold beverages";
    var sentence = "I like " + subject + ".";


Note:
When the plus operator is used in conjunction with strings, it will "concatenate" the two strings.

---

## Let's Develop It

Create a new HTML file. 

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My Site!</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        My site!
      </body>
    </html>


---

## Let's Develop It

Create a new javascript file (a file that ends in .js) 

Link it to your html file 

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My Site!</title>
        <script src="javascript.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        My site!
      </body>
    </html>

## Let's Develop It
<br>
**Lifetime supply calculator** 

Ever wonder how much a lifetime supply of your favorite snack or drink is? 

---

## Lifetime supply calculator

1. Store your age in a variable 
1. Store your maximum age in a variable 
1. Store an estimated amount per day in a variable 
1. Calculate how many you would eat/drink in your lifetime 
1. Output the result in an alert...


    alert(answer);


---

## The if statement

Javascript can run through code based on conditions 

    if (condition here){
      // statement to execute
    }


An example...


    var bananas = 1;
    if (bananas < 2){
      console.log("Buy more bananas!")
    }


---

## Comparisons

|Symbol|Meaning|
|---|---|
|===|Equality|
|!==|Inequality|
|>|Greater than|
|>=|Greater than or equal to|
|<|Less than|
|<=|Less than or equal to|


Don't confuse = (assign a value) with === (compare a value) 

Note:
The 3 equal signs mean "equality without type coercion". Using the triple equals, the values must be equal in type as well.

---

## Chaining Conditions

Compound conditions with two ampersands (&&)...


    var bananas = 5;
    var oranges = 2;

    if (bananas > 3 && oranges > 3) {
      console.log('Eat fruit!');
    }



---

## Chaining Conditions

|Symbol|Meaning|
|---|---|
|&&|AND|
|&#124;&#124;|OR|
|!|NOT|


    if (bananas < 2 || oranges < 2) {
      console.log('Buy fruit!');
    }

    if ( !(bananas >= 0) ) {
      console.log('You have negative bananas??');
    }


---

## If/Else Statement

You can use else to perform an alternative action if the "if" fails

    var bananas = 5;
    if (bananas > 3){
      console.log('Eat a banana!');
    } else {
      console.log('Buy a banana!');
    }

---

## If/Else Statement

You can use else if to have multiple choices

    var age = 20;
    if (age >= 35) {
      console.log('You can vote AND hold any place in government!');
    } else if (age >= 25) {
      console.log('You can vote AND run for the Senate!');
    } else if (age >= 18) {
      console.log('You can vote!');
    } else {
      console.log('You have no voice in government (yet)!');
    }

---

## Let's Develop It

Add an if/else statement to our lifetime supply calculator so that if the lifetime supply is greater than 40,000, you say "Wow! That's a lot!" otherwise, say "You seem pretty reasonable!"

---

## Functions

Functions are re-usable collections of statements

Declare a function

    function sayHi(){
      console.log('Hi!');
    }

Call the function

    sayHi();

---

## Arguments

Functions can take named arguments


    function sayHi(name){
      console.log('Hi' + name + '!');
    }
    sayHi('Mitch, the Red Panda');
    sayHi('Harold, the hippo');

    var name = 'Pip, the mouse';
    sayHi(name);

---

## Arguments

Functions can take MULTIPLE named arguments

    function addNumbers(num1, num2){
      var result = num1 + num2;
      console.log(result);
    }

    addNumbers(5, 6);

    var number1 = 12;
    var number2 = 15;
    addNumbers(number1, number2);

---

## Return Values

Functions can return a value


    function addNumbers(num1, num2){
      var result = num1 + num2;
      return result; //Anything after this line won't be read
    }
    var sum  = addNumbers(5, 6);

---

## Variable Scope

JavaScript variables have "function scope." They are visible in the function where they are defined

A variable with "local" scope:

    function addNumbers(num1, num2){
      var result = num1 + num2;
      return result; //Anything after this line won't be read
    }
    var sum  = addNumbers(5, 6);
    console.log(result); //will return undefined because result only exists inside the addNumbers function

---

## Variable Scope

JavaScript variables have "function scope." They are visible in the function where they are defined

A variable with "global" scope:


    var result;
    function addNumbers(num1, num2){
      result = num1 + num2;
      return result; //Anything after this line won't be read
    }
    var sum  = addNumbers(5, 6);
    console.log(result); //will return 11 because the variable was defined outside the function

---

## Let's Develop It

Wrap the lifetime supply calculator in a function called calculate()

Add a link to the html that calls the function when it is clicked

    <a href = "#" onclick="calculate()">
    Calculate life time supply
    </a>
