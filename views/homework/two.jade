        li Now use an <code>if/else</code> statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like <i>'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien'</i>, and if not, log a string like <i>'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'</i>
