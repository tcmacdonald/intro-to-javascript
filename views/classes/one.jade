        li Write a function called <code>half_number</code> that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like <strong>"Half of 5 is 2.5."</strong>.
        li Write a function called <code>percent_of</code> that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like <strong>"2 is 50% of 4."</strong>
        li Write a function called <code>area_of_circle</code> that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like <strong>"The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."</strong>
        li <i>Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.</i>
